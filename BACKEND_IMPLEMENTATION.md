# Secure Backend Implementation - Complete

## 🎯 Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive, secure backend system for your job management application with:

- **Multi-stage user lifecycle**: `pending → user → admin`
- **Transferable job ownership**: Immutable creator, mutable owner
- **Strict API-level access control**: RLS + middleware protection
- **Real-time updates**: Live synchronization across all clients
- **Comprehensive testing**: Full test coverage for all scenarios

## 📊 Architecture Summary

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced users table with approval workflow
users {
  id: UUID (PK)
  email: TEXT (UNIQUE)
  full_name: TEXT
  role: 'pending' | 'user' | 'admin' (DEFAULT 'pending')
  approved_at: TIMESTAMP (NULL by default)
  approved_by: UUID (FK to users.id)
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}

-- Jobs table with ownership separation
jobs {
  id: UUID (PK)
  venue: TEXT
  job_id: TEXT (UNIQUE)
  status: 'draft' | 'live' | 'processing' | 'complete' | 'error'
  created_by: UUID (FK, IMMUTABLE - original creator)
  owner_id: UUID (FK, MUTABLE - current owner for permissions)
  collaborators: UUID[] (array of user IDs)
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}

-- Activity logs for audit trail
activity_logs {
  id: UUID (PK)
  user_id: UUID (FK)
  action: TEXT ('USER_APPROVED', 'USER_ROLE_CHANGED', 'JOB_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFERRED')
  details: JSONB (structured event data)
  status: 'success' | 'failure' | 'pending'
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Critical Security Rules:**
- ✅ **Pending users CANNOT interact with jobs** (enforced at DB level)
- ✅ **Only owners/admins can modify jobs** (automatic via RLS)
- ✅ **Only admins can view activity logs** (exclusive access)
- ✅ **Admins cannot change their own role** (API-level prevention)

## 🔐 API Endpoints

### Authentication & User Management

| Method | Endpoint | Role Required | Description |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/users/me` | Any authenticated | Get current user profile |
| `PUT` | `/api/users/me` | Any authenticated | Update own profile |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/users` | Admin | Get all users |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/users/:id` | Admin | Update user role/data |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/users/:id` | Admin | Delete user |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/logs` | Admin | Get activity logs |

### Job Management

| Method | Endpoint | Role Required | Description |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/jobs` | User/Admin | Get accessible jobs |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/:id` | User/Admin | Get single job |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs` | User/Admin | Create new job |
| `PUT` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Owner/Admin | Update job |
| `DELETE` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Owner/Admin | Delete job |
| `PUT` | `/api/jobs/:id/owner` | Owner/Admin | Transfer ownership |

## 🚀 Real-time Features

### Live Updates Across All Clients
- **Job Changes**: Instant notifications for create/update/delete/transfer
- **User Lifecycle**: Real-time approval/role change notifications  
- **Connection Status**: Auto-reconnection with user feedback
- **Selective Updates**: Only relevant users receive notifications (RLS-filtered)

### Usage Example
```typescript
// In any component
const { jobs, loading, isConnected } = useRealtimeJobs();

// Automatically receives live updates for:
// - New jobs created
// - Ownership transfers  
// - Status changes
// - Job deletions
```

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suites

**1. Access Control Tests**
- ✅ Admin route protection
- ✅ Non-admin rejection  
- ✅ Pending user restrictions
- ✅ Unauthenticated access denial
- ✅ Admin self-modification prevention

**2. User Lifecycle Tests**
- ✅ New user signup (pending state)
- ✅ Admin approval process
- ✅ Post-approval functionality
- ✅ Role promotion (user → admin)
- ✅ Activity logging verification

**3. Job Ownership Tests**
- ✅ Job creation (creator = owner initially)
- ✅ Ownership transfer success
- ✅ Former owner access denial
- ✅ Admin override capabilities
- ✅ Transfer logging

**4. Real-time Tests**
- ✅ Connection establishment
- ✅ Live update delivery
- ✅ RLS-filtered subscriptions

**5. Security & Edge Cases**
- ✅ Invalid ID handling (404s)
- ✅ Malformed request protection
- ✅ SQL injection resistance (RLS)
- ✅ Authorization boundary testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm run test:api          # Access control tests
npm run test:integration  # End-to-end workflows  
npm run test:coverage     # Coverage reports
```

## 🔄 User Lifecycle Workflow

### Complete Journey: Pending → User → Admin

```typescript
// 1. User signs up → Starts as 'pending'
// 2. Admin approves → Role: 'user', approved_at/approved_by set
// 3. User can now create/manage jobs
// 4. Admin promotes → Role: 'admin'  
// 5. New admin gains full system access

// All transitions logged in activity_logs with full audit trail
```

## 🏗️ Job Ownership Model

### Immutable Creator + Mutable Owner Design

```typescript
interface Job {
  created_by: string;  // IMMUTABLE - original creator for audit
  owner_id: string;    // MUTABLE - current owner for permissions
  // ... other fields
}

// Transfer example:
// User A creates job: created_by = A, owner_id = A
// Transfer to User B: created_by = A, owner_id = B (A loses control)
// Admin can override any transfer
```

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Database RLS**: Postgres-level row filtering
2. **API Middleware**: Role-based route protection
3. **Function Security**: Database functions with SECURITY DEFINER
4. **Input Validation**: Request sanitization and validation
5. **Audit Logging**: Complete activity trail

### Business Rules Enforced
- ❌ Admins cannot modify their own role
- ❌ Pending users cannot interact with jobs
- ❌ Non-owners cannot modify jobs (except admins)
- ❌ Only admins can view system logs
- ✅ All sensitive operations are logged

## 📡 Real-time Architecture

### Supabase Realtime Integration
- **RLS-Aware Subscriptions**: Only see data you have permission for
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles network interruptions gracefully
- **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly update notifications
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for real-time status

# Required environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Set up test users and data
psql -f tests/setup/test-database.sql
