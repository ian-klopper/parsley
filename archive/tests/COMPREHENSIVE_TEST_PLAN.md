# Comprehensive Test Plan for Parsley Application

## Test Strategy Overview

This test plan ensures complete coverage of all user roles, permissions, and functionality including edge cases and error scenarios.

## 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 1.1 Admin User Tests
- ✅ Can access all pages (dashboard, job detail, admin panel, activity logs)
- ✅ Can see ALL jobs regardless of collaborator status
- ✅ Can manage all users (approve, suspend, delete)
- ✅ Can view activity logs
- ✅ Cannot be set to pending status
- ✅ Can transfer ownership of any job
- ✅ Can add/remove collaborators on any job
- ✅ Can delete any job

### 1.2 Regular User Tests
- ✅ Can access dashboard and job pages
- ✅ Can only see jobs they collaborate on
- ✅ Cannot access admin panel (should get 403)
- ✅ Cannot access activity logs (should get 403)
- ✅ Can create new jobs
- ✅ Can manage jobs they own (delete, transfer ownership)
- ✅ Cannot delete jobs they don't own
- ✅ Can be added as collaborator
- ✅ Can be made job owner (auto-becomes collaborator)

### 1.3 Pending User Tests
- ✅ Can ONLY access pending page
- ✅ Cannot access dashboard (redirects to pending)
- ✅ Cannot access job pages (redirects to pending)
- ✅ Cannot access admin panel (redirects to pending)
- ✅ Cannot create jobs
- ✅ Cannot be added as collaborator
- ✅ Must wait for admin approval

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 Authentication Flow
- ✅ New users can create account (enters pending status)
- ✅ Login with valid credentials works
- ✅ Login with invalid credentials fails with error
- ✅ No access without authentication (redirect to login)
- ✅ Session management across tabs
- ✅ Logout clears session properly
- ✅ Google OAuth integration works on port 8080

### 2.2 Authorization Boundaries
- ✅ API endpoints check user role
- ✅ API endpoints check ownership
- ✅ API endpoints check collaborator status
- ✅ Failed auth returns 401
- ✅ Failed authorization returns 403
- ✅ Invalid requests return 400

## 3. Job Management

### 3.1 Job Creation
- ✅ User can create job with required fields
- ✅ User can assign any user as owner
- ✅ Owner automatically becomes collaborator
- ✅ Multiple collaborators can be added
- ✅ Validation for empty/invalid data
- ✅ Activity log entry created

### 3.2 Job Ownership
- ✅ Only owner can delete job
- ✅ Only owner can transfer ownership
- ✅ New owner becomes collaborator automatically
- ✅ Previous owner remains collaborator after transfer
- ✅ Non-owners get error on delete attempt
- ✅ Activity log tracks ownership changes

### 3.3 Job Visibility
- ✅ Users see only collaborative jobs
- ✅ Admin sees all jobs
- ✅ Non-collaborators cannot view job details
- ✅ Job list updates in real-time

## 4. Collaborator Management

### 4.1 Adding Collaborators
- ✅ Owner can add collaborators
- ✅ Admin can add collaborators to any job
- ✅ Making user owner auto-toggles collaborator
- ✅ Cannot add pending users
- ✅ Cannot add duplicate collaborators
- ✅ UI reflects changes immediately

### 4.2 Removing Collaborators
- ✅ Owner can remove collaborators
- ✅ Cannot remove job owner as collaborator
- ✅ Admin can remove collaborators from any job
- ✅ Removed users lose access immediately

### 4.3 Edge Cases
- ✅ Toggle collaborator when making owner
- ✅ Prevent owner from being non-collaborator
- ✅ Handle concurrent collaborator updates
- ✅ Validate user exists before adding

## 5. Activity Logging

### 5.1 Logged Actions
- ✅ User creation
- ✅ User status changes
- ✅ Job creation/deletion
- ✅ Ownership transfers
- ✅ Collaborator changes
- ✅ Failed operations
- ✅ Authentication attempts

### 5.2 Log Details
- ✅ Timestamp accuracy
- ✅ User identification
- ✅ Action description
- ✅ Success/failure status
- ✅ Error messages for failures
- ✅ Affected entities (job_id, user_id)

## 6. UI/UX Testing

### 6.1 Layout Consistency
- ✅ Two-panel layout on all pages except login
- ✅ Back arrow navigation works
- ✅ User avatar with initials in top-right
- ✅ Navigation menu from user icon
- ✅ Responsive design

### 6.2 Modal Behaviors
- ✅ Create job modal validation
- ✅ Edit team members modal
- ✅ Owner change confirmation
- ✅ Delete confirmation dialog
- ✅ Error message display

## 7. Database Operations

### 7.1 Data Integrity
- ✅ Transactions complete or rollback
- ✅ Constraints enforced (unique, foreign key)
- ✅ Cascading deletes work correctly
- ✅ Concurrent updates handled

### 7.2 Performance
- ✅ Queries optimized with indexes
- ✅ Pagination for large datasets
- ✅ Connection pooling works
- ✅ No N+1 query problems

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 Client Errors
- ✅ 400 for invalid input
- ✅ 401 for unauthenticated
- ✅ 403 for unauthorized
- ✅ 404 for not found
- ✅ Meaningful error messages

### 8.2 Server Errors
- ✅ 500 errors logged
- ✅ Database errors handled gracefully
- ✅ Network timeouts managed
- ✅ Retry logic for transient failures

## 9. Edge Cases & Boundary Testing

### 9.1 Input Validation
- ✅ Empty strings
- ✅ Special characters
- ✅ SQL injection attempts
- ✅ XSS attempts
- ✅ Very long strings
- ✅ Unicode characters

### 9.2 Concurrent Operations
- ✅ Multiple users editing same job
- ✅ Simultaneous collaborator updates
- ✅ Race conditions in ownership transfer
- ✅ Parallel API requests

### 9.3 State Transitions
- ✅ Pending → Active → Suspended cycles
- ✅ Collaborator → Owner → Collaborator
- ✅ Login → Logout → Login
- ✅ Create → Delete → Recreate

## 10. Integration Testing

### 10.1 API Integration
- ✅ All endpoints return expected format
- ✅ Error responses consistent
- ✅ Authentication headers work
- ✅ CORS configured correctly

### 10.2 Real-time Updates
- ✅ Job list updates live
- ✅ Collaborator changes reflect immediately
- ✅ Status changes propagate
- ✅ WebSocket connections stable
