# End-to-End (E2E) Testing Guide

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for testing the full flow functionality of the Parsley application. The goal is to ensure that all features operate as expected, from user authentication to data extraction, including handling of edge cases.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin testing, ensure you have the following:

*   A running instance of the Parsley application (local or staging environment).
*   Access to user accounts with different roles (e.g., admin, regular user).
*   Familiarity with the application's features and user interface.
*   A tool for taking screenshots and recording videos to document issues.

## 3. Testing Strategy

Our E2E testing strategy involves simulating real-world user scenarios to verify the application's functionality from start to finish. We will focus on the following:

*   **User-centric workflows**: Testing complete user journeys, such as creating a job, uploading a file, and verifying the extracted data.
*   **Role-based access control**: Ensuring that users can only perform actions that are permitted by their roles.
*   **Data integrity**: Verifying that data is created, updated, and deleted correctly across the application.
*   **Cross-browser and cross-device testing**: Ensuring a consistent experience across different browsers and devices.

## 4. Core Functionality Testing

### 4.1. User Authentication

1.  **Login**: Verify that a user can log in with valid credentials.
2.  **Logout**: Verify that a user can log out successfully.
3.  **Invalid Login**: Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed for invalid login attempts.
4.  **Session Management**: Verify that the user's session is maintained across browser tabs and that it expires after a certain period of inactivity.

### 4.2. Job Management

1.  **Create Job**: Verify that a user can create a new job with a venue name.
2.  **View Job**: Verify that a user can open a job and view its details.
3.  **Update Job**: Verify that a user can update the job's status and collaborators.
4.  **Delete Job**: Verify that a user can delete a job.

### 4.3. File Management

1.  **Upload File**: Verify that a user can upload a file (PDF, PNG, JPG, Excel, CSV).
2.  **View File**: Verify that a user can preview the uploaded file.
3.  **Delete File**: Verify that a user can delete an uploaded file.

### 4.4. Data Extraction

1.  **Start Extraction**: Verify that a user can start the data extraction process.
2.  **Verify Extraction Results**: Verify that the extracted data is accurate and matches the content of the uploaded file.
3.  **Edit Extracted Data**: Verify that a user can edit the extracted data.

### 4.5. Collaboration

1.  **Add Collaborator**: Verify that a user can add a collaborator to a job.
2.  **Remove Collaborator**: Verify that a user can remove a collaborator from a job.
3.  **Transfer Ownership**: Verify that a user can transfer ownership of a job to another user.

## 5. Edge Case Testing

### 5.1. File Uploads

*   Upload files with the maximum allowed size (10MB).
*   Upload files with unsupported formats.
*   Upload corrupted or empty files.
*   Upload multiple files simultaneously.
*   Interrupt the file upload process (e.g., by closing the browser tab).

### 5.2. Data Extraction

*   Run extraction on a file with no text.
*   Run extraction on a file with handwritten text.
*   Run extraction on a low-quality image.
*   Run extraction on a file with a complex layout.

### 5.3. Concurrency

*   Have multiple users edit the same job simultaneously.
*   Have multiple users upload files to the same job simultaneously.

### 5.4. Permissions

*   Try to access a job that you are not a collaborator on.
*   Try to edit a job that you do not have permission to edit.
*   Try to delete a job that you do not own.

## 6. Test Data

Use a variety of test data to ensure comprehensive testing. This should include:

*   **Real-world data**: Use real receipts and menus to test the data extraction accuracy.
*   **Synthetic data**: Create test data to cover specific edge cases, such as items with long descriptions or unusual characters.

## 7. Reporting

When you find a bug, please report it with the following information:

*   **Title**: A clear and concise summary of the issue.
*   **Steps to Reproduce**: A detailed, step-by-step description of how to reproduce the issue.
*   **Expected Result**: What you expected to happen.
*   **Actual Result**: What actually happened.
*   **Screenshots/Videos**: Attach screenshots or videos to help illustrate the issue.
*   **Environment**: The browser, operating system, and device you were using when you encountered the issue.
