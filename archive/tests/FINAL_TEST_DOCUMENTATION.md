# Final Comprehensive Test Documentation

## Database Schema Summary

Based on analysis, the actual database schema is:

### Users Table
- `id`: User ID
- `email`: User email
- `full_name`: Full name
- `initials`: User initials
- `avatar_url`: Avatar URL
- `role`: User role (admin/user)
- `color_index`: Color for UI
- `approved_at`: Approval timestamp (null = pending)
- `approved_by`: ID of approver
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Update timestamp

**Status Logic**: User is "pending" if `approved_at` is null, otherwise "active"

### Jobs Table
- `id`: Job ID
- `venue`: Venue name
- `job_id`: Job identifier
- `created_by`: Creator user ID
- `owner_id`: Current owner ID
- Various other fields for job data

**Collaborators**: Stored in application logic, not directly in database

### Activity Logs Table
- Standard activity logging fields
- Tracks all user actions

## Complete Test Suite

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Tests

#### Test: New User Registration
```javascript
// Manual Test Steps:
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter email and password
4. Verify user is created with approved_at = null (pending status)

// Automated Test:
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'newuser@example.com',
  password: 'Test123!'
});
// Check user has approved_at = null
```

#### Test: Admin Role Access
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to /admin
3. Should see admin panel
4. Navigate to /logs
5. Should see activity logs

// Verification:
- Admin can access all pages
- Admin can see all jobs regardless of ownership
- Admin can approve pending users
```

#### Test: Regular User Access
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Login as regular user
2. Try to navigate to /admin - should be blocked
3. Try to navigate to /logs - should be blocked
4. Navigate to dashboard - should work
5. Should only see jobs they own or collaborate on
```

#### Test: Pending User Access
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Create new user account
2. Before admin approval (approved_at = null)
3. Try to access dashboard - should redirect to pending page
4. Try to create job - should be blocked
5. Only /pending page should be accessible
```

### 2. Job Management Tests

#### Test: Job Creation
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Login as active user
2. Click "Create Job"
3. Enter venue name
4. Select owner (can be self or another user)
5. Add collaborators
6. Submit

// Validation:
- Job is created with correct owner_id
- Owner is automatically a collaborator
- Activity log entry is created
```

#### Test: Job Ownership
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Create job as User A
2. Try to delete job as User B - should fail
3. Delete job as User A - should succeed
4. Transfer ownership from User A to User B
5. Now User B can delete

// Business Rules:
- Only owner can delete job
- Only owner can transfer ownership
- Admin can manage any job
```

#### Test: Job Visibility
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Create Job1 with User A as owner
2. Create Job2 with User B as owner
3. Add User B as collaborator to Job1
4. Login as User A: should see Job1 only
5. Login as User B: should see Job1 and Job2
6. Login as Admin: should see all jobs
```

### 3. Collaborator Management Tests

#### Test: Adding Collaborators
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Open job details as owner
2. Click "Edit Team Members"
3. Add new collaborator
4. Save changes

// Validation:
- New collaborator can now see the job
- Cannot add pending users
- Cannot add duplicate collaborators
- Activity log shows collaborator added
```

#### Test: Auto-Toggle Collaborator on Owner Change
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Create job with User A as owner
2. In create/edit modal, change owner to User B
3. System should automatically toggle User B as collaborator
4. Save changes

// Validation:
- New owner is in collaborators list
- Previous owner remains collaborator
```

#### Test: Removing Collaborators
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Open job with multiple collaborators
2. Remove a collaborator (not the owner)
3. Save changes

// Validation:
- Removed user cannot see job anymore
- Cannot remove job owner from collaborators
- Activity log shows removal
```

### 4. Activity Logging Tests

#### Test: All Actions Are Logged
```javascript
// Actions that must be logged:
- User registration
- User approval/suspension
- Job creation
- Job deletion
- Ownership transfer
- Collaborator add/remove
- Failed login attempts
- Permission denied attempts

// Verification:
1. Perform each action
2. Check activity_logs table
3. Verify timestamp, user_id, action, details
```

### 5. Edge Cases & Error Handling

#### Test: Special Characters
```javascript
// Test venues with:
- "Caf√© Jos√©'s"
- "Restaurant & Bar"
- "‰∏≠ÂõΩÈ§êÂéÖ"
- "üçï Pizza Palace"
- Very long names (255+ characters)
- SQL injection attempts: "'; DROP TABLE jobs; --"
```

#### Test: Concurrent Updates
```javascript
// Manual Test:
1. Open same job in two browser tabs
2. User A adds Collaborator X
3. User B adds Collaborator Y simultaneously
4. Both should succeed or handle gracefully
```

#### Test: Invalid Data
```javascript
// Test with:
- Empty venue names
- Non-existent user IDs
- Malformed email addresses
- Extremely long strings
- Null values where not allowed
```
